## 🔍 What I Explored Today

On Day 8, I learned how to **create groups** in Tableau — a helpful feature that lets us combine multiple values of a dimension into a single grouped value.

This is very useful for simplifying complex datasets, performing grouped analysis, and reducing the number of marks in a view.

## 📘 What is a Group in Tableau?

In Tableau, a **Group** allows you to **combine multiple dimension members** into a single label or category.

It does **not affect the original data**, but creates a **new field** representing the grouped values.

### 🧠 Why is Grouping Needed?

Often, datasets contain **too many categories**, many of which may be small or not individually relevant. Grouping helps by:

- 🔢 **Reducing clutter** on visualizations
- 🧹 **Simplifying** your data story
- 📊 Enabling **aggregate comparisons**
- ✅ Helping you focus on broader business groupings

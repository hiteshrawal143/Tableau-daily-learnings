# 🖼️ Screenshots – Tableau Visualizations

This folder contains **screenshots of all visualizations** created as part of the Tableau Daily Learning journey.

## 📂 Structure:

- `Day1/` – Screenshots of Day 1 visuals (if any)
- `Day2/` – Bar Chart and Tree Map
- `Day3/` – (to be added)...

Each image corresponds to the `.twbx` workbook of that day and is used to provide a quick preview of the created dashboards or charts.

✅ All screenshots are taken from Tableau Desktop Public Edition and exported in JPG format.

📌 Screenshots are helpful for quick reference without opening the workbook files.

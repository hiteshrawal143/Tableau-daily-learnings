# 📅 Day 1 – Introduction to Tableau

## 🧠 What is Tableau?

Tableau is a **data visualization and Business Intelligence (BI)** tool. It helps you to:
- Understand data visually (graphs, charts, dashboards).
- Discover patterns and insights.
- Make smart decisions using interactive visuals.

You don't need coding knowledge to use Tableau – it works mostly with **drag and drop**.

# Tableau-daily-learnings
This repository contains my daily learnings, notes, and practice files while exploring Tableau. Each day includes key concepts, sample dashboards, and insights gained from hands-on practice. The goal is to track progress, maintain consistency, and build a strong portfolio in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics using Tableau.
